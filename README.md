Hihi!

This `v3` branch contains the source code for my personal website, available at [featherbear.cc](https://featherbear.cc)

Being a git repo and all, you can also find the older website revisions in the `archive_v*` branches.  
_It's probably not very interesting to do that though..._  
You'll probably find much more interest in reading through **[this blog post](https://blog.featherbear.cc/post/site-redesign/)**

##### Notes for the curious

* This site is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), my Javascript UI framework of choice (I don't like React).  
* Routing is handled with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) which is a server framework for Svelte.
* CI/CD is handled with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/featherbear/featherbear.github.io/blob/v3/.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml) which builds and deploys my code to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
* Because I didn't want to use LaTeX, my [resume](https://featherbear.cc/resume/) PDF is generated with some [dodgy script](https://github.com/featherbear/featherbear.github.io/blob/v3/scripts/buildPDF.js) that wrote.
