# Hey there üëã

I'm currently a fifth year student at the [University of New South Wales](https://unsw.edu.au) in Sydney, Australia pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.  
Prior to that I did Electrical Engineering, but found myself more fascinated with hardware design.

You might have found my site from Google, some code I wrote, a friend, one of my [UNSW course note sites](/blog/post/unsw/)... or maybe you're a bot.  
Either way, welcome!

# Get to know me real quick

## üíª [Hardware & Software](/programming)

> Code monkey, hardware hacker... I make and break things - though mainly the latter...

My interests lie in multimedia, networking, and dev o(o)ps - though realistically the reason I write software is so that I don't have to pay for them.  
I also do something involved with cyber security, but like you don't need to know that üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## üì∏ [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/_andrewjwong/)

> ‚ÄúAlright on three... three!‚Äù

When I'm not doing wedding photography, you can probably find me spending hours and hours in the exact same spot capturing the gorgeous landscapes and sceneries around us.  
_Or..._ looking like a lunatic whilst carrying around a bunch of random lights for some creative portraits or light paintings.  

## üé¨ [Audio / Visual Production](/blog/categories/audio-visual/)  

> ‚ÄúCamera 2, iris up.‚Äù √ó ‚ÄúIs this thing on?‚Äù

I'm one of those people who you don't know exist, until we mess up.  

There's no hope for me in front of a camera or microphone, but I can sure make others look and sound good!  
From corporate events like conferences, to weddings, to concerts and festivals, I mainly work as a live sound engineer (mixing audio) and broadcast engineer (video production and livestreaming), but basically I'm a _"jack of all trades, master of <s>none</s> some"_.  

## üé∏ Music

When I was younger I was forced to learn piano, then I was forced to learn clarinet, and then I was forced to learn saxophone.  
Nowadays I may or may not have an unhealthy amount of guitars..

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Misc

Sports? Table Tennis, and going on hikes/walks (if you consider that a sport...)  
Sleep deprived? Absolutely.  
Hotel? Trivago.

Favourite Emoji: üî•

# Services

I offer consultation services for software development and IT system deployments.

## Wishlist

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that I sort of want to buy, that maybe you could.. buy?  
_jk haha.. unless..?_

üß¶ Socks - Yes I've reached that age in life where I value these as gifts  
üßµ CAT6 Ethernet cables - The best type of wireless is the hard-wired ones  
üì∑ Camera stuff - Buy me some Canon LP-E6NH batteries please, or maybe an EF lens..  
üíª Laptop - Yeah I don't actually have my own.. shock horror!  
üéÅ Surprise me

Money just sitting in the bank is money just sitting in the bank ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
