## üíª Computing

Interested in things related to security, multimedia and communications.  

**Security**  
In this day and age, information security has been the forefront of attention time and time again. I've come to appreciate the necessity to both understand and promote cyber vigilance to all. I've written a RAT, fuzzer, and even my very own Capture The Flag server, as well as having taught several security courses at UNSW.

**Multimedia**  
Giant LED walls, live show programming, geeking out on new microphones, cameras, stacking layers of compression... Digital technology has continued to improve the production value of TV, music, videos, theatre, concerts and so much more. Multimedia has been my creative outlet - spending time doing AVL, photography, videography and music. It gets so much more interesting when multimedia is combined with digital technology! I've worked on several projects that enabled me to tie my interests together and enjoy them simultaneously
