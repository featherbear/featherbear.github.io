November was the month of spending for me. From preparing Christmas gifts, to being too eager and impatient to wait for Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales (_But do they even happen down here in Australia???_).

In anticipation for Cyber Monday, I had started to look and prepare for a [new computer build](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/gvfK4n) - but after a few unforeseen turn of events, I had decided to delay those purchases, and opt for buying a collection of other things.  

One of these things included buying some equipment to connect my laptop (Dell Latitude 7390) to my multi-monitor displays at home.

> Previously, I had been connecting my laptop to a USB-C PD + Gigabit Ethernet dongle, then using either [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/). Whilst both great products, I did wish that I could get the responsiveness from physical interaction. And also that I don't have that much space to 'dock' my laptop.  
**Well not any more.**

To actualise my idea, I opted for a USB-C Dock and DisplayPort KVM solution.

USB-C Dock - I want to have _one_ cable, which can charge my laptop, extend the video signal, and also carry a gigabit network connection. USB-C was clearly the choice here, with its Power Delivery standards.  
I decided upon the **[Dell WD15 USB-C Business Dock](https://www.dell.com/en-au/work/shop/dell-business-dock-wd15-with-180w-adapter/apd/452-bcfx/pc-accessories)**, as I had found a good deal for AUD $89 - what a steal!

DisplayPort KVM - As DisplayPort MST exists, I would be able to connect just one cable from my laptop, and daisy-chain DisplayPort MST-compatible displays together to get an extended display.  
I decided upon the **[ATEN CS782DP DisplayPort KVM](https://www.aten.com/au/en/products/kvm/desktop-kvm-switches/cs782dp/)** as it had good reviews and, whilst pricey, had support for the MST feature I needed for multi-displays

Though I could have saved money on the dock and opted for a USB-C KVM, I found this dock + KVM combo a better choice, as I needed both devices to maintain a network connection, and that both devices would be able to output an audio signal into my audio matrix.
