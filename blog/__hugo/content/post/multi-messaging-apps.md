With so many messaging platforms and work-related productivity services popping up left, right and centre it becomes a hassle to keep so many browser tabs or desktop apps open.

I've been using Franz for the past couple of years, and sometimes when I try to drag and drop an image into the Facebook Messenger tab, it crashes.
