[NewTek NDI](javascript:alert(\'Not implemented\')) is a really amazing actually suite of software designed to transport audio and video data over networks.  
_Note: I recommend a gigabit connection between the producers and consumers, as it easily saturates 100 MB/s with all settings max'd._


I've been using it a while:

* Screen recording
* Laptop screen streaming - Scan Converter on the laptop, Virtual Input on the desktop
* [RICE Rally 2018](../rice-rally-2018-sydney) - Use OBS to create composites from several NDI sources
