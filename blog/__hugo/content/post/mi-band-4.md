My brother and I have been eyeing on a sale for the Mi Band 4, and we finally swooped to buy them at $40 AUD each!

I used to have a Mi Band 2, and one thing I liked about it was being able to see my Facebook Messenger notifications on them.  
The Mi Band 4 is definitely an upgrade.

For starters, it has a larger screen with a much higher resolution. I can also adjust the brightness of the display!  
In terms of functionality, it also has a weather feature, notification history, and even media player control functionality!
