Here's to spending too much money in November ðŸ¥‚

---

So yeah, it happened.  
I finally got around to purchasing a 35mm prime lens for my camera!

> A year ago, I had purchased the YongNuo 35mm f/2 lens for about $160.  
It took a month for it to arrive, which to my dismay was the wrong lens mount!  
&nbsp;  
I had received the Nikon mount even though I had ordered the Canon mount!  
&nbsp;  
It was a big hassle to get it sent back overseas to the seller, and it got stopped in customs - needing me to pay to **return** the item?!  
I got my money back from PayPal's Buyer Protection, but they weren't able to cover the $40 customs fee.  
&nbsp;  
Ugh fine - cop the $40, get the $120 back, and move on.

So that was last year. This year I stumbled upon a good deal for a Canon 35mm f/2 IS USM lens!  
AUD$588 for a pre-owned "as-new" condition lens was a steal, given that it's usually $900!

Upon receiving and inspecting it, it definitely did look as if it was "as new" as it could be!  
Not a blemish or mark in sight, and the optics were crystal clear!

I'm pretty excited to be able to use this lens soon!
