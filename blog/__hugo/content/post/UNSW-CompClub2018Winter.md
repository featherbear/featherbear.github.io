## Day One - Introduction to Python

## Day Two - Microbits
[Microbit by BBC](https://microbit.org) is a small piece of hardware with all sorts of sensors and outputs.  
The uni purchased 20 of these!  
Unfortunately, the accelerometer module isn't the best, and alot of the students couldn't get one of the workshop instructions working.

The first activity was to build a [firefly](https://ncase.me/fireflies/), using the wireless radios on the Microbit.  
When the button is pressed, the LEDs would light up, [also lighting up other nearby Microbits](https://ncase.me/fireflies/).  

> So... I could write a radio spammer... [hmmmm](javascript:alert(\'Not implemented!\')).



The second objective of the day was to build a reflex game - where you time how long it takes you to press the button from when some event happens.  
Most students used the LED as the event soure, a few used audio cues.

> This activity was a good way to slowly ease the idea about 'hacking the system' - if you hold the button before the game starts, you could win with 0ms on the clock.

  
The last objective was to create some sort of Bop-It game, with the button and sensors.

Some of the older kids didn't really want to do these stuff as it was abit menial.. I'd think so too.  
So instead they decided to transcribe the Mii Channel theme song for the Microbit...

## Day Three - Game Development
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) is a graphics/game library for Python that gives us a canvas to put things on!  
The students created their own version of Space Invaders; coding in the player, the enemies and missiles!

There were a few challenge activities, such as being able to shoot missiles.  

> See my version of the game: [GitHub](https://github.com/featherbear/UNSW-CompClub2018Winter-SpaceInvaders)

## Day Four - Website Development
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python web microframework that allows people to serve (non-static) websites.  
[PythonAnywhere](//pythonanywhere.com) kindly gave us some free accounts on their Education plan :)

In terms of content, we didn't follow what was written - because the actual person who had written the content.. was erm... MIA.  
So instead of making a blog site (w/ SQL), we just taught the basics of website development and got people to make a page of whatever they wanted

## Day Five - Security
The last day of the workshop (nooo) was security day, where they talked about lockpicking, ciphers and then hosted a small Capture the Flag game.  
I felt that ciphers were a bit hard to teach to highschoolers (especially a whole class), because if you don't understand one bit, you've immediately fallen behind the rest of the class.  
And... cryptograpy in general is quite brain intensive..

The CTF was fun, although we had one [technical issue](../unsw-compclub2018summer) with the server. (_Don't use Flask's development server in production!)

# That being said
My face is on the new HS1917 brochure!  
HS1917 is a computing course for year 10-12 students in high school; not that I had the opportunity to do it :(
