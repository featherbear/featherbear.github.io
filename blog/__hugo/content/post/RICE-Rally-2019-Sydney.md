I'm [back at it again](../rice-rally-2018-sydney) doing vision playback for RICE Rally 2019 at ICC Sydney!



**Technologies**:

* Playback - ProPresenter 6
* Playback - CasparCG
* Video Transport - NewTek NDI
* Video Mixing - Open Broadcaster Software

_See [Production on a Budget](../production-on-a-budget)_

**Technical**:

_Timecode_ ProPresenter 6 does not have any timecode slave triggering, and we didn't have any software (PVP, and a Mac) on us that would allow for that.  
We had to manually sync the track by counting over our intercoms...

My brother dealt with the Stage Display and Lower Thirds lyrics for the side screens, so those were two less responsibilities I had to worry about for this event.
