Got my hands on a [Behringer X-Touch Mini](https://www.musictribe.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/X-TOUCH-MINI/p/P0B3M) USB MIDI Controller (Yay for Facebook Marketplace).  
Will be using this in my Lightroom editing workflow!

# Configuration
## Changing the MIDI Mapping
The X-Touch Mini has 12 white buttons. With two layers, that would give us 24 different buttons. However some of the buttons were mapped to the same MIDI control key aka - some buttons are duplicate.
So firstly, we'll need to remap the surface.

* Download the [X-Touch Editor](https://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/X-TOUCH-MINI/p/P0B3M/downloads) app
* Run X-Touch Editor
* Connect the Behringer X-Touch Mini
* Load profiles into the device

I used [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Lmb8xu6_dCNlZ3aGFBajFuWVk/view?usp=sharing) preset (thanks [Dan](https://www.danorst.com/single-post/2017/07/26/xtouch)!)


## MIDI2LR Mapping
* Download [MIDI2LR](https://rsjaffe.github.io/MIDI2LR/)
* Install into Lightroom
* Run MIDI2LR
* Press buttons on the MIDI device. Entries will appear in the MIDI2LR window, where you can assign actions

## Wireless Control
-> Buy a MIDI to Bluetooth Adapter

Voila!
