[Hugo]:https://gohugo.io

I've been using the awesome [Aether theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/aether/) on this blog for about 4 months.  
Whilst there was alot of desirable aspects, it sort of didn't entirely work with my posts... And I didn't know how to customise [Hugo]...  

So the solution? **Make your own theme**!

I initially copied all the files from Aether into this theme, then just played around with each file

In the usual fashion, I used [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for my CSS framework.  
For syntax highlighting, Aether used highlight.js, but a bit of googling had pointed me to using [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)
