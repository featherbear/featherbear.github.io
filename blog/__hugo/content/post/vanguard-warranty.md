Last year my friend borrowed one of my tripods :)  
It got water damage.  
It corroded.  

Damn you Brandon.

This time my [friend](https://www.instagram.com/bdon.kn/) went out to Norway to take some beautiful photos.  
Guess who borrowed another of my tripods.  
Guess who broke another tripod.  

That's right!

# PSA: Don't put tripods as luggage - Bring it on the plane!

So, the tripod head somehow had dislodged from the body sometime and somewhere during his airplane flight back to Australia.  

Who knows...  

The spring (that sort of looks like a thread adapter..) was warped out of shape...  
I would try to bend it back, but I won't be able to make it perfectly circular...

Anyway, I've contacted Vanguard regarding warranty. Hopefully I get a replacement spring for this tripod.
