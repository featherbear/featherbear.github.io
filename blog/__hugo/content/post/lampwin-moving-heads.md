I recently purchased two [Chinese brand moving heads](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/2x-30W-RGBW-LED-Moving-Head-Light-DMX512-Stage-Party-DJ-Pub-Bar-Show-Lighting-AU/202635836645?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649) from [eBay](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/2x-30W-RGBW-LED-Moving-Head-Light-DMX512-Stage-Party-DJ-Pub-Bar-Show-Lighting-AU/202635836645?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)

I was not expecting to receive quality, but I did receive amusement and amazement as to how much enjoyment $70 could bring me. As a stage production guy, you know quality when you see it. This definitely was not quality, but it was indeed well built.

It packs a 30W CREE LED, 8 colours (with split), and 8 different gobos.  
Colours are controlled by a single channel as with most cheap fixtures

Some issues were that the LED wouldn't output anything until around 30 / 255, also the reflected movements from single DMX increments for the pan and tilt were very coarse, and it was difficult to get a smooth slow moving beam.

I've yet to open it up to see what's actually inside.

I recently used one of them (for the fun of it) at my church's Easter Tenebrae service, where the light dimly lit up the wooden cross at the rear of the hall. And as the lit candle was blown out, I slowly dimmed the light to black.
