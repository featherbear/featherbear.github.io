Uni holidays. Preoccupied myself with watching some Korean Drama.  
My friend recommended me some series called City Hunter.  
And... it... was... alright actually!  
I even watched some bits at 1x speed!

> Spoiler Time  
Some Koreans go and do a secret mission in North Korea.  
They complete their objective, but their gov chucks a sneaky and abandons them.  
One survives, then steals the newborn of a fallen comrade's wife and raises him up.  
Kiddo carries out fake dad's revenge; but not the way that fake dad wants  
- so lil' bit of rivalry and yeah..

That said, me being a computer network guy...  
You're always subconsciously on the lookout for hacking fakery.
