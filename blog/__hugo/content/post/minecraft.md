> So I, used to be [pretty into](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/bearbear12345) Minecraft.  
_That was, back in 2008._  
&nbsp;  
In primary school, I used to play with my friends on a vanilla server, Icecraft.  
In high school, I started getting into modding and server administration.
We played with the [Feed The Beast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/) modpack, and eventually we played our own modpack, BearCrack.  
&nbsp;  
I got into server administration - running servers, and contributing to [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) plugins.  
In fact I helped write Minecraft Server Dashboard - [Website](https://navhaxs.au.eu.org/minecraft-dashboard/) [Minecraft Forums](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/1265318-)
&nbsp;  
I also managed a server called FreakyNova, owned by some guy in Norway.  
&nbsp;  
**But that was years ago**.  
&nbsp;  
I stopped playing Minecraft in around 2013, right before [Microsoft acquired Minecraft](https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/15/microsoft-has-acquired-minecraft/).  
I think the angsty 'me' thought that the game would fall into ruin, I was upset that Notch (game founder) had sold **and left** the company.

Fast forwards to today, around 6 years later... it looks like they're not doing that bad.  
So in a bid to procrastinate from [university](../unsw), I decided to download Minecraft and give it another go.

_Screenshots taken with [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/) + [BSL Shaders](https://bitslablab.com/)_

Alot has stayed the same, especially that blocky pixel feel.  
Although install shaders and it's a whole new world.

There's definitely a lot more added.  
New creatures, blocks, tools, villagers _**do**_ stuff now!  
With dual-weilding added in [15w31a](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_15w31a), the OptiFine mod added a feature to allow torches in the off-hand slot to radiate light.  
Seems like a pretty overpowered way to mine with just one torch...
