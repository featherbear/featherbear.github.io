> In a world full of noise, how do we find what we're really looking for?

[RICE Movement](https://ricemovement.org) is a Christian organisation that brings the message of Jesus to high schoolers (of Australia, and now New Zealand too!)  
[RICE Rally](https://www.facebook.com/RICERally/) is their annual event, a big evangelical 'rally'.

I got the opportunity to serve with my [brother](//navhaxs.au.eu.org) in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).

Our playground was three LED walls (and two confidence monitors)!!!
