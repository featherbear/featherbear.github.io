RICE is a Christian movement that reaches out to high schoolers (>>>)

RICE Rally is their annual event, a big evangelical 'rally'

I got the opportunity to serve with my [brother](//navhaxs.au.eu.org) in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).

Our playground was three LED walls and two confidence monitors.  
LED Walls - Left, Centre, Right; Left and Right screens cloned (so two discrete displays)  
Confidence Monitors - Two cloned displays
