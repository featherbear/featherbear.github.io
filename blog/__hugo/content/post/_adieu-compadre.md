I'm writing this to my future self...  
But also to anyone who might be facing something like this too.

_When does a friendship turn into a romantic relationship? How does it start?_

I was naive, comfortable and adamant about thinking I knew what I wanted.  
But it was this stubborness that took hold - and prevented me from taking a chance.

It's so damn true.

You never realise what you had until it's gone...

It was so wild, we gave each other the wildest journey trying to figure out if we liked each other or not...  
The only thing that I regret from this friendship, was not confessing sooner.
It wasn't timing, but hesitancy that had made this missed opportunity.

All these hints and nudges, I subconsciously dusted them aside.  
Man I was so dumb.  

And there I was, so regularly getting upset at her - for big things, for little things.  
So many heated arguments, unnecessarily long bickering, late night calls -  
But why was I getting upset? If she was just a friend, why was I hurting so much?  

Evidently, I listened to my brain more than I did to my heart...  
It was a fettered love.

Love is a crazy thing, it makes no sense why you love someone.  
It's not because of their looks, their brains, I dare say it's not even their heart or attitude...  
Just - you love them for, them...

There's so many things that I'm going to miss, and so many things we can't do anymore. 

It's not a goodbye; we're far from over as friends.

If you like someone... don't hesitate to tell them.  
Don't lead yourself on a heart-wrenching mindless struggle that never had to be there.

# Bliss
```
The feeling of bliss.

When all of your worries and concerns vanish. They disappear as if they never existed.

You feel at peace.

To lay down all of your responsibilities, and cast your mind to joy.

It's something that I'd be joyful for.

But putting down your responsibilities - what does that entail? 
When you neglect your responsibility, when you neglect your duty, when you neglect your promises and vows - It might hurt someone
