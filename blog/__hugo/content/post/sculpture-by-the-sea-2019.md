This year I volunteered for Sculpture by the Sea Bondi, making it my second year volunteering here (I volunteered before in 2015!).

![](20191106_082359.jpg)

# Roles

There were a few roles that I was assigned to during my shifts

* Metrics - counting people
* Surveying - asking people to fill in a form
* Patrol - general staff presence
* Data entry - Entering in the voting data
* Catalogue marquees - Selling merchandise and information booklets!

# Experience

## It&apos;s Sculpture by the Sea, NOT SculptureS by the Sea.

Yeah.

## People like receipts, except for when they don&apos;t.

To manage payments, SxS uses [Square Up](https://squareup.com/au/en) - payment devices that can be connected to their kiosk iPads.  
Consequently, without an EFTPOS terminal, receipts are paperless and have gone digital.

But it's an inconvenience for a customer holding a child in one hand, and all of their other stuff in the other - to use their third hand to type in their phone number / email address.  
... Yeah, exactly.

## Things aren&apos;t free, but if you&amp;re bougie that&apos;s okay.

From my time at the catalogue marquees, the majority of people who will actually purchase something are white people.  
The Asian people, especially those whom I will classify as tourist (given the presence of a selfie stick in their hand and/or a down jacket and/or the non-Australian vibe) will ask for a Catalogue Guide but then put it back down after being told it is $7.  

As an Asian myself surrounded in an Asian community, I do see this "miser spending" culture.  
But at the same time I'm confused because the majority of iPhone 11 Pros I've seen have been held by Asians.  

What? You can afford a $2000 smartphone, but not spend $7 on a Catalogue Guide that will infinitely increase your enjoyment at SxS? Hm.

# Number 23.

From all of the voting forms that I had entered in, it was easy to see that there was a clear winner - Sculpture #23 - being the voted sculpture every 9 in 10 forms.

Trivia: He was a UNSW Alumni!

If he doesn't win the vote for whatever this voting form was for, I'll be upset.

My favourite sculpture this year would probably have been _Transience_ by Cave Urban.

Yes, it's just a glowing ball of bamboo.  
BUT IT'S A GLOWING BALL OF BAMBOO HOW COOL WOULD TAKING PHOTOS OF IT BE!

It was really fun volunteering at SxS 2019!  
Would I do it again next year? Maybe... If I have time!

And here's my obligatory mail-merged certificate:
