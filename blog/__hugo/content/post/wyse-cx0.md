# Specs

Processor: VIA C7 @ 1 GHz  
Memory: 512 MB SODIMM  
Flash: 44-pin 128 MB  
Networking: 10/100/1000 Ethernet  
USB: 6x USB 2.0  
PS/2: Keyboard, Mouse  


What am I going to do with it? I was thinking to use it as an [NDI](../newtek-ndi) stream receiver.  

That would mean installing a copy of Windows Vista/7 Embedded.  
But first I would need more than 512 MB of RAM, and definitely more than 128 MB of storage...

For the RAM, I had a spare 2 GB SODIMM chip lying around, so that was fine.  
For the storage, I have to purchase a **44-pin to SD card adapter**, and throw in an SD card into the mix.  
In addition, I would need a **44-pin ribbon cable**, to fit the adapter in the unit.

Ordered. and. waiting.

# Update: 13th July

_I bought the wrong ribbon cable._  
I had purchased a standard IDE ribbon cable instead of a 44-pin ribbon cable.

Oops.

# Update: 20th August 2019

Both the 44-pin ribbon cable and 44-pin to SD card adapter has arrived.  
Project on hold until [RICE Rally 2019](../rice-rally-2019-sydney) is over though!

# Update: 26th August 2019

I've installed Windows 7 Embedded onto the device.  
and.  
"NewTek NDI Tools require a CPU with SSE3 instructions".

Well that was a let down.

On the bright side, I've gotten myself a portable (though underpowered) Windows 7 device that I could use.. for something...
