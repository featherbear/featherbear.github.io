A while ago I applied for a position at a company which taught children how to code...  
Today I got an email back with a programming challenge, let's have a crack at it!

<summary>The Challenge (click to expand)</summary>
<i>In order to solve the challenge you will need to download and learn a new (and very simple) coding language, I hope you will enjoy the challenge.

Please install the [Small Basic software](http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/A/F/CAF9E062-94D3-4003-80D9-44CDF7EC7BD9/SmallBasic.msi) and review the [tutorial](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/6/90616372-C4BF-4628-BC82-BD709635220D/Introducing%20Small%20Basic.pdf).  
You can find more materials on the [Small Basic site](http://smallbasic.com/).  

**The Challenge**  
Develop a shooting game, the player goal is to shoot the balloon down.  

**Controls**

* The player can move the cannon up and down using the arrow keys
* To fire a bullet the player will press [SPACE].

**Rules**

* The balloon should move up and down randomly.
* The player can shoot one bullet at a time.
* Only when the bullet is out of the game then the player can shoot again.
* The game ends when the balloon is shot down, please show the amount of missed shots.
* The bullet speed should be 1.5 times the speed of the balloon.
* The balloon can change directions (up or down) at any time.

Okay cool, [Small Basic](http://smallbasic.com) - I've heard of it but I've never used it before.  
That can change.

# Exploring Small Basic
So first thing's first with learning any new language, is knowing how to write it!  
The tutorial document ([Introducing Small Basic.pdf](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/6/90616372-C4BF-4628-BC82-BD709635220D/Introducing%20Small%20Basic.pdf)) goes over the intro - though I'm going to summarise it here for my own reference.

<details>
<summary>Syntax (click to expand)</summary>
## General
* No semicolons ðŸ™ƒ
* Variables are dynamically typed
* Strings and integers can be joined together (`"I am " + 19 + " years old!"`)
* Indentation is not important
* Commenting: `' Start with a single quote`

```
TextWindow.Write("Enter your name: ")
name = TextWindow.Read()
   TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!")
' TextWindow.WriteLine("You won't see this line")
```


## Flow
* No switch-case
* If-Then-ElseIf-Then-Else-EndIf
* No OR, AND - We have to nest and stack If-Then and Else statement
* Logical operator EQ with single `=`
* Logical operator NEQ with `<>`


## Label:, Goto
* Yeah uh - no.

## Loops
### For-To-EndFor
```
For i = 1 To 24
  TextWindow.WriteLine(i)
EndFor
```

#### For-To-Step-EndFor
```
For i = 10 To 1 Step -1
  TextWindow.WriteLine(i)
EndFor
```
### While-EndWhile
```
number = 0
While (number < 100)
  number = number + 1
EndWhile
```

## Maths
* No modulo operator - Use `Math.Remainder(n, modulo)`
* Division returns a float

## Subroutines
```
Sub PrintTime
  TextWindow.WriteLine(Clock.Time)
EndSub
```

## Functions
* No functions exist

## Arrays
SmallBasic's `array` type is actually more like a dictionary, indexes can be integers and strings.  
Also doesn't look like we need to declare nor define our array variable. (***screams internally***)

Assignment of an array into another array is passed by copy, rather than reference

With that said, officially - indexing starts at 1 (ONE)


## Graphics
SmallBasic gives us `GraphicsWindow`, `Shape`, and `Turtle` to do our graphical mayhem.

The first thing to do was to set up the game window

As per the genre of a classical 2D arcade shooting game, we'll need the typical things:

* Player movement - The player will need to move up and down
* Enemy movement - The movement of the enemy
* Projectile movement - The movement of the gunball
* Score system - The number of gunballs shot. Final score is the number of *missed* shots (so score = n-1)
* Hit detection - Register if the projectile has hit the enemy

... and sprites!  
... music and SFX would be nice too, but no thanks.

---

We sort of have a choice, to create the sprites first then fit the code around the sprites - or to write the code first and then fit the sprites to the code.  
The latter is better,  
but I did the first.

So fire up Photoshop (or [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) in my case), and make a few sprites!

---

Step two was to set up the game window, something like an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 (measuring the dimensions of the game window in the challenge specifications)

---

Step three would be then to start writing the game code.  
Since I had recently made the sprites, I wanted to write the code to display them on the screen.

Small Basic **doesn't have user functions**, but only subprocedures (_that's kinda dumb..._), meaning that the code in the subprocedure will be accessing arbitrary values in the global scope. ugh...  
To keep my sanity, I made an array which would hold the arguments, and also another array to return values.

Arrays bother me, _as you will read later on in the [Final Thoughts](#final-thoughts)_, so for more sanity protection, I defined my `args`, `rets`, and `objs` 'arrays'

So in similar fashion to writing in Assembly, before I call my `obj_init` 'function', I would load my arguments into the `args` array 'registers'

--- 

Step four, implement player movement!

Small Basic **doesn't have AND, or OR operators**, meaning that if you wanted to write something like
```
if (a && b) { ... }
```
You would have to write 
```
If a Then
  If b Then
    ...
  EndIf
EndIf
```

The player movement would need to be restricted to the bounds of the game window, so as to not allow the player to move out of the screen

---

Step five, pew pew!

To implement the gunball (and its movement) we'll need to use some sort of timer interval to move the gunball.  
Small Basic has `Shapes.Animate([shapeName], [x], [y], [durationInMilliseconds])` - but it seems to have an easing motion, which isn't what we wanted, so I used the `Shapes.Move` function.

When the gunball leaves the screen, it should disappear, and the player will be allowed to fire a new gunball (maximum of one gunball on the screen at a time)

---

Step six, Up!

_Aside: Pixar's 2009 animation Up is actually such a powerful narration of love..._ anyway.

The balloon should move up and down the screen, and every while and then it should change direction - I chose a randomness 1%.  
We also need to change the direction if the balloon reaches the bounds of the game window.

Since my balloon sprite has a string attached (_and a balloon won't pop if you poke it by the string_), I allowed the bottom of the balloon sprite to pass the bounds of the game window.

---

Step seven was to code the collision / hit detection of the gunball and the balloon.

Because my balloon sprite had a string attached, I had to manually define the hitbox regions (_where the balloon actually was in the sprite_).  
It was also circular, meaning that I would have to do some fancy maths for hit detection - but I wasn't bothered

So yes, the hit detection is off, but oh well.

---

The last steps were to implement the end game message, which would tell the player the number of gunballs missed (_aka, the number of gunballs fired minus one_). Also a few more state variables and flags to tie up some loose ends (no string puns intended)


---

# Game Time
![](animation.gif)

Because of my not-so-well-written hit detection algorithm, I sometimes experienced false-positive game ends - as I would expect.  

Otherwise, on the whole it works!!!

# Final Thoughts
Small Basic combines Microsoft's syntax ecosystem with something like Python's syntax to create a beautiful mess.  
No I'm kidding, honestly it's a pitiful mess.  

**Firstly**, `arrays`.  
The thing that shocks me the most - that you don't need to declare the type of the variable, but can instantly do `something["like"] = "this"` without even saying what `something` is.  
Even Python would tell us that `something` is not defined.

**Secondly**, `goto` statements. Oh boy.  
Whilst `goto` has its use (_does it really???_), I recommend against it as it's not programmatic.  
`goto` is used in the official tutorial, and that really irks me.

But that said, Small Basic ***does*** have its quality - Especially having a graphical framework (GraphicsWindow, Shapes, ImageList, Turtle) built-in. For introducing people to programming, I would say that it's quite solid. 
 
But that also said, something like Python also has the `turtle` library.

I think this will be my first, and last time using Small Basic.
