The [PreSonus StudioLive 16](./PreSonus-StudioLive-16) and StudioLive 24R have an EtherCON port for their AVB connection.  
You could forego the EtherCON connector and just connect an Ethernet cable, but I've had one occassion where a network stagebox got disconnected because the cable got kicked off.  

Neutrik sells several EtherCON kits, the two I bought were [Neutrik NE8MC](https://www.neutrik.com/en/product/ne8mc) and the [Neutrik NE8MC-1](https://www.neutrik.com/en/product/ne8mc).  
(Didn't need the CAT6 series, which would've been the NE8MX6 series)  

The NE8MC is for **already assembled / terminated** cables, and has a clip-on bushing.  
The NE8MC-1 is for **unassembled / unterminated** cables - you need to push the cable through the bushing before you attach on the RJ45 connector.
