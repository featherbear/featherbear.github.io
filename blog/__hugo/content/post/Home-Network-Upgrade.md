I love GumTree, have I ever told you that?  (I also thoroughly enjoy Facebook marketplace too)

Ubiquiti UniFi UAPs
TEN DOLLARS EACH
(No, not the ACs unfortunately.. the first ever ones.. but hey save $50 per piece)

10/100 not 10/100/1000
To my dismay, these APs were only 100FDX and not 1000FDX.
But my old APs weren't gigabit either. so it's not like my network became worse
