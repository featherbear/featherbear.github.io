[Filmstrip Messages]:https://featherbear.github.io/filmstrip-messages/

About two weeks ago, I stumbled upon Codrops' [Photo Booth Strips](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/01/photo-booth-strips-with-lightbox/) project, and I reckon it looked pretty sweet.  
Diagonal scrolling, how cool!  
So I decided to write my own as an exercise.

Fast-forwards to today, and I've finally finished a release-able version of my project named [Filmstrip Messages].

I spent a bit of time drawing and animating a mailbox vector graphic that appears as a loading page.  
I'm quite proud of how it turned out :)

This project served to be one of the first real projects I've done using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) JavaScript framework.  
I quite like how simple and straightforward developing with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) has been, and I can't wait for the next projects I'll have to use it again.
