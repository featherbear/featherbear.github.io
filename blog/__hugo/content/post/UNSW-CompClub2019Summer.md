I got the opportunity to take part in my uni computer society's highschool program (again)!  
Last time (Winter 2018) I volunteered as a mentor - those people who would help guide the students.  

This time around I helped out as an organiser, in particular a content writer.  
That means that I get a whole day to do whatever the heck I want! Yeeeeet!  
The theme is "Secret Agent", and I got assigned to do the security stuff :D  


# Writing the Workshop
I planned my day to have a learning component, a CTF component.
