For the past `n` years, I've been using [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) as my go-to Windows SSH client.  
I guess I didn't use it to its fullest potential, but it did everything that I needed.  

That is, it _used_ to do everything that I needed...  
I'm starting to use [Mosh](../mosh) now, and so I needed to find a new SSH/Mosh client.

So with that said, say hello to **Termius**.

[Termius](https://termius.com) (formerly known as Server Auditor) is a cross-platform SSH/Telnet/Mosh client.  
And it's hella adorable (Electron thoooo).

Luckily for me, the basic plan was all that I needed

# Appearance
IT'S SO AESTHETIC!  
Termius has inbuilt themes - though the default theme is already beautiful as is.  
I don't think you can customise the themes though.  

Same goes for the fonts, you can choose from a selection commonly used terminal fonts, but you can't use your own.

# Local terminal
Termius also gives you access to a local terminal - On Windows: `cmd` and `powershell`.  
But you can also add your own terminals, like `bash`
