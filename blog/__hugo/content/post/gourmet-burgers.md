This semester I had a group assignment where we had to create an online ordering system for a ficticious company called GourmetBurgers.  
Albeit it being a group assignment, and alot of waiting for my partners to finish their code; overall I found this assignment really fun to complete!

Especially to get a nice UI that would ultimately contribute towards 0% of my grade!
