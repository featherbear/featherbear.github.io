A certain friend of mine is a magnet for having dropped phones and broken screen protectors (_Hey, have you tried... walking and not looking at your phone?_).  
I've purchased several different protectors for them, and myself too - and I wanted to just maintain a list of the protectors I've bought, and my thoughts on them

> Albeit, the glass is probably all from the same place...

Erm. I think it's more their fault than the protector's. _What!? It's never my fault!_|

|![](https://i.eBayimg.com/images/g/M2wAAOSwi1lb-5eq/s-l1600.jpg)|AU$39.99|[BESTSUIT](https://www.bestsuit.net/) LOCA Protector|[eBay](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/UV-light-full-glue-adhesive-tempered-glass-liquid-screen-protector-for-s8-s9-s9p/223256050484?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=522042573015&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)|Their UV light had some QC issues, but functionality was fine nonetheless.<br>The packaging of the protector was great, it had a magnetic flip cover, and even a scratch sticker to check the serial number!<br><br>Installation was super easy! That being said, I managed to allow two _tiny_ bubbles but they're barely noticable!<br>I reckon though, the instructions on the guide should tell you to pull off the nozzle cover BEFORE unscrewing the lid - as you'd exert some deal of force on the glue bottle causing it to spill out a little bit.<br><br>The glass size still doesn't cover the entirety of the screen unfortunately (Whitestone 1:0), and in fact, it feels a little smaller than the rest of the protectors (it covers the camera elemts though!?!?).<br>I would recommend this! Oh, and definitely keep the frame and positioning cover that comes with this!!!|
|![](https://i.eBayimg.com/images/g/oLIAAOSwCCtbUAVV/s-l1600.jpg)|AU$2.65|EASTele Hydrogel Film Screen Protector|[eBay](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/3x-EASTele-HYDROGEL-AQUA-Screen-Protector-Samsung-Galaxy-S10-S9-S8-Plus-Note-9/303104767060?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=602035348372&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649)|I didn't like this one that much. You can definitely notice a difference in texture with a film protector compared to a tempered glass one - and having used tempered glass since the very beginning, it just feels wrong. There's also a feint horizontal line in the middle of the screen due to the way that the installation is done.|

**LOCA** stands for Liquid Optically-Clear Adhesive. It's a liquid glue technology that boasts in better screen protector adhesion and light transmission.  
Whitestone has their flagship Dome Glass which - where I live to - costs about AU$100 to get it professionally done, or AU$80 to purchase for DIY.  

But $80 for a protector??? Woah.  Australia doesn't have free lifetime warranty which is a bummer.
