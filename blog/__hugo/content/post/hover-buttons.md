So I made a little website demo to show CSS hovering animations.  
It's pretty cool! Usually you would add your `transition: ...` on an element...  
**But**, if you apply it on the `:hover` or `:not(:hover)` selectors, you can make the transition happen only during hover-enter or hover-exit events!
