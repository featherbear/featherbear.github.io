So I found this custom game cd cover that my [brother](https://navhaxs.au.eu.org) had drawn up and made!

It's for a computer game called Lego Loco.  
It's a virtual sandbox game where you design and run cities, and more importantly... TRAIN. #SydneyTrainsGiveMeAJobPlease

For a game released in 1998, it's pretty amazing.  
I remember playing the game with my brother in 2004/2005, on our crummy Windows XP computers.  

Something that amazed me around that time was this yellow CAT5 crossover cable that my brother had rewired and crimped himself.  
Something that amazes me now, is the fact that this game, released in 1998 had local LAN multiplayer support! Like... what!!!

Because the game is built for Windows 95/98/XP, it's not able to run on Windows 8/10.

...

Well, anything's possible really.

# Installation

If you don't have the game disc like I did, it's not too hard to find a copy of the game online.

(That said, I also downloaded the game from the online mirrors, because... who has a CD drive these days?)

Mounting the game ISO and running the installer, we're greeted with a memory from the past - InstallShield.  
Oooh, what a flashback.

If the original installer doesn't work, you might like to try out this [Alternative Installer](https://github.com/le717/LOCO-Alternate-Installer)

# Running

This game has a hard-coded maximum resolution of 1280 x 1024, so in order to play it I had to change my screen resolution, as well as deactivate my other monitors.

With my screen resolution changed, the game starts successfully!  
There are a few bugs in the game, and sometimes the graphics glitches out on the menu screen - but game functionality is there!

I'm quite happy that the game still works on Windows 10!  
It's also quite amusing that multiplayer menu in the game lets you "choose" a TCP game connection - because _everyone knows_ what TCP is!
