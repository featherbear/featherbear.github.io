Group work is always ... interesting.  
For software development especially, there are so different many ways that you could write a procedure.  
And for the exact same procedure, there so many different syntactical nuances that could differ too.  

And that's why style guides, and documentation is important!

That said, my [COMP2521 Assignment 2 (Fury of Dracula)](https://featherbear.github.io/UNSW-COMP2521/blog/post/ass02/) was a group (pair) assignment.  

So, the obvious question is - who does what part, but more importantly; how do we edit **together**.  

The usual response would be something along the lines of "So that we don't overwrite each others' work, you do this file, and I do that file"  
Or, use some sort of version control system like Git or SVN.  


...

I stumbled upon this service called [Floobits](http://floobits.com/).  

It has a Free plan which gives you 5 public workspaces (no private workspaces on the free plan).  
The Small plan offers 5 private workspaces for USD$15/mo. But I'm poor so no thanks, free will do.

Unlike the online code scratchpads like Codeshare, Floobits gives you a 'project view', allowing you to upload multiple files

# IDE
Atom, Sublime, JetBrains, Online Editor

# Flootty
Something pretty cool with Floobits is that they have a collaborative terminal


# Issues
Sublime Text Editor went crazy with **SOURCE FILE CHANGED RELOAD PLS** messages (paraphrased.)
Effectively it made it impossible to code together with my partner.  

The compromise was that I would use my IDE, whilst my partner used the Floobits online editor (it's not bad!)

(I have a tendency to press Ctrl+S alot..)
Also (I think) pressing Ctrl+Z (Undo) plays up a bit.
