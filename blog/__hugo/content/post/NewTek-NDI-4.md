On the 13th September 2019, NDI released version 4 of their free NDI Tools software suite.

For all I care, the biggest benefits are:

# KVM Support for Scan Converter & Studio Monitor

You can use a computer running Studio Monitor to KVM into a computer running Scan Converter.  
This is pretty amazing, considering how low-latency the NDI protocol is in general.

# NDI Recording with Studio Monitor

Originally, you had to use an NDI recorder software, but now this feature is built in natively, amazing!

# Virtual Input x WebRTC

For a while, websites that utilised WebRTC for video media did not behave nicely with Virtual Input.  
Those sites included Facebook Messenger and Discord.  

With the update of NDI Tools 4, it's fixed! (Although supposedly it was fixed in 3.7)

Needless to say, I am very pleased with what NewTek has been offering.
