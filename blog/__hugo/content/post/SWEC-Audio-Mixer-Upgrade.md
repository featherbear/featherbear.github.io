# XLR to TRS Cables
TOO SHORT OH NO
Spare microphone cable cuts lying around, and could make my own
(My soldering iron is screwed up, the tip wasn't hot and I had to use the sides of the iron to do my soldering...)

I had some XLR to TS cables lying around, though on all of them pins 1 and 2 were bridged.
I could have desoldered them 
Copper conductive tape 
But didn't want makeshift
