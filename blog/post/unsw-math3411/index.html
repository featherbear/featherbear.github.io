</code></pre><h1 id=background-context>Background / Context</h1><p>I entered UNSW in 2018, undertaking an Electrical Engineering (Honours) and Computer Science (Security) double degree.<br>Being an <a href=http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/plans/2018/COMPY13785.html>elective</a> for my Computer Science stream, I decided to pick up MATH3411.<br><em>That said, out of sheer enjoyment for computing I&rsquo;m still doing more than the needed number of electives!</em></p><p>So this trimester I was studying under full load: MATH3411, MATH2069, and COMP2511.</p><h1 id=course-content>Course Content</h1><p>The course effectively began with an introduction to ISBN numbers - those things you see in libraries (If anyone goes to those anymore), and how they have a checkbit to ensure the integrity of the code.</p><p>Next were code protocols that could detect and correct errors - Binary Hamming codes.<br>I found this topic really cool, as it (as childish as it sounds) felt like being a detective cracking a code. (Well, more of that feeling goes to cryptography and <a href=https://featherbear.github.io/UNSW-COMP6441/>COMP6441</a>, but you get the gist)</p><p>My next highlight was compression coding and Markov sources, where encoding was dependent on the previously encoded data.<br>We also went over LZ78, which was a lossless text compression algorithm. Fun but probably not practical.</p><p>Next was polynomial fields - needless to say, it was quite confusing. Especially when missing out 3 weeks of Friday content due to volunteering at Sculpture by the Sea.<br>But after understanding the theory and knowing how to approach the questions, it became fun.<br><em>Although very prone to mistakes being made which would detrimentally ruin everything else&hellip;</em><br>More Sherlock Holmes vibes though!</p><p>Chapter six went over algebraic coding and BCH codes.<br>This was <strong>probably the hardest chapter for me</strong>. And it really took some time to sit down and read over a few times to <em>start</em> understanding.<br>I didn&rsquo;t like this chapter too much.</p><p>The final chapter was Cryptography!<br>I understand that alot of this chapter was &ldquo;More for your interest&rdquo; - so not too much of this chapter was assessable.<br>Because of other commitments I wasn&rsquo;t able to attend these lectures, but thankfully I had a prior knowledge to crypto <a href=https://featherbear.github.io/UNSW-COMP6441/>inside</a> and outside of UNSW.</p><hr><p>From all of the topics, I struggled a bit with Two-error BCH codes and Binary Channels.<br>Entropy and probability aren&rsquo;t my forte :P</p><h2 id=trimesters>Trimesters</h2><p>I believe trimesters did not have too much of a considerable impact on my experience of this course.<br>However several topics were skipped over due to there being a lack of time to cover everything in assessable depth.</p><h1 id=digital-uplift>Digital Uplift</h1><p>Being the test subjects of the course&rsquo;s Digital Uplift - we were the first to experience the online lab tests.</p><p>From doing each of the three lab tests multiple times, I understand that there is a bank of questions where each generated test will pick from.<br>After a while, you would see the exact same question appear again meaning you could technically memorise the answers.<br>Whilst this is good (as a student), I think <u>it would be even better if each question also had its values randomised</u> - much like how the PHYS1131 and PHYS1231 lab test questions were.</p><p>My rationale behind this is that given values might (or might not) fall into a specific edge case.<br>Since these tests are practised individually without any authoritative guidance, one might correlate values and come to the conclusion that there is a link between those values - when in fact there might not be.</p><hr><p>For example, if I said that a function $f$ behaves like the following:</p><ul><li>$f(1,0) = 1$</li><li>$f(2,1) = 3$</li><li>$f(3,3) = 6$</li></ul><p>You might infer that $f(a,b) = a + b$</p><p>If you were asked $f(20,5)$, you&rsquo;d probably then think <em>&ldquo;Okay to solve this question, I add 20 and 5 to get 25&rdquo;</em>.<br>You submit the answer, and then &hellip; <strong>WRONG - Correct answer: 395</strong>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because $f(a,b) = a^2 - b$ !!!</p><p>Now, if the question only ever asked for $f(4,6)$, you would <strong>never realise that you were doing it wrong</strong>.<br>You&rsquo;d write 10 as the answer, and see it marked as correct. But as soon as $f(20,5)$ appears in your written final exam - You&rsquo;d be oblivious that your methodology, and ultimate your answer is wrong.</p><hr><h1 id=farewell>Farewell</h1><p>It was cool to see how matrices could be used, and how topics from other courses tied in (Such as using eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Markov sources).<br>Being a security student, I also especially enjoyed the cryptographic topics - though glossed over due to time.</p><p>Overall I found MATH3411 a very enjoyable course!</p><p>Thomas was an amazing lecturer, as also thought by a few of my friends too!<br>During the final lecture, we (&hellip; Well I did, they were too scared to go up) gave Thomas a little gift! <em>(No - not the apartment, and no - not the wooden stick)</em>.</p><p><img src=screely-1575511118873.png alt></p><p>May your proof-by-hand-waving forever hold true ~</p><script type=text/javascript>window.MathJax={tex2jax:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']]},showProcessingMessages:false,messageStyle:'none'};</script><script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha256-nvJJv9wWKEm88qvoQl9ekL2J+k/RWIsaSScxxlsrv8k=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></article></main><div class=container><h1 class="title has-text-grey-lighter">More posts</h1><div class=listArticle><a href=/blog/post/laptop-dock/><article class=media><div class=media-content><h2 class="title is-marginless">Laptop Dock</h2><div class=level><div class=level-left><p class=subtitle>Finally connecting my laptop to my monitors...</p></div><div class=level-right><p>Posted <time datetime=2019-11-16>Nov 16, 2019</time></p></div></div></div></article><div class="is-unselectable categories"><a href=/blog/categories/life><span class="tag is-info">#Life</span></a>
