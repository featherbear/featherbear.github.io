For the past n years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using PuTTY as my go-to Windows SSH client.
I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it to its fullest potential, but it did everything that I needed.
That is, it used to do everything that I needed&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m starting to use Mosh now, and so I needed to find a new SSH/Mosh client.
So with that said, say hello to Termius.</description></item><item><title>Mosh</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/mosh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 14:39:16 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/mosh/</guid><description>Mosh is a remote terminal application that aims to overcome the issues that many other protocols face.
For me, Mosh addresses the lack of roaming support and intermittent network connectivity that I would face when trying to connect to servers whilst on the train or anywhere on the go.
(semi)technicalities Mosh connects to the server machine over SSH, meaning that there is no concern of a new avenue of vulnerability.</description></item><item><title>Fear and Tension</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/fear-and-tension/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 11:12:03 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/fear-and-tension/</guid><description>Fear is subjective, tension is objective. - Some YouTube video.

Aided by sound effects, music, lighting, dialogue and story telling; our minds are synchronised with in-game character; and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing to consider that it was all purpose-driven by the game creators.

I wanted to add functionality to the PreSonus StudioLive 16 Series III](../PreSonus-StudioLive-16) console. For example, to fade the level of a channel instead of instant (un)muting.
There is no MIDI interface for the console - so we would have to emulate the network messages sent from their UC Surface app.

I stopped using Firefox in the late of November 2016, when Mozilla decided to pull the plug on, and severely restricted Firefox&amp;rsquo;s add-on platform, in favour of their WebExtensions API.

Flask vs Tornado Why Flask Flask has a much easier to use routing functionality, where you just need a Python decorator @app.get(...).
In Tornado you need to set up a site router, and all these other things (or I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it right)
Why Tornado Tornado is a non-blocking server, which is able to handle multiple requests at the same time.</description></item><item><title>HTML Script Tags</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/html-script-tags/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2018 00:44:52 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/html-script-tags/</guid><description>Source - growingwiththeweb.com

You know the saying: &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is&amp;rdquo;.
So my friend wanted to upgrade from their iPhone to a Galaxy S9+.
Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much about getting brand new goods (exceptions exist), so off to the races!
Hopped on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace to check for some sweet deals.
I found a few classifieds from a store called Masters iPhone - supposedly located in Western Australia.</description></item><item><title>Whoops There Goes My AI</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/whoops-there-goes-my-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:44:41 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/whoops-there-goes-my-ai/</guid><description>GitHub: featherbear/Whoops-There-Goes-My-AI
So there&amp;rsquo;s a game on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store called Whoops! There Goes My Orange.
You play as an orange falling from the sky, and you have to avoid the red bars. Simple, right?
Yep! But rage-inducing.
Anyway, so I decided to have a crack at writing some sort of AI for this game&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;d just be a collision avoidance algorithm&amp;hellip; not really an AI.</description></item><item><title>RICE Rally 2018 Sydney</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/rice-rally-2018-sydney/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 19:19:44 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/rice-rally-2018-sydney/</guid><description>In a world full of noise, how do we find what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for?
RICE Movement is a Christian organisation that brings the message of Jesus to high schoolers (of Australia, and now New Zealand too!)
RICE Rally is their annual event, a big evangelical &amp;lsquo;rally&amp;rsquo;.
I got the opportunity to serve with my brother in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).
Our playground was three LED walls (and two confidence monitors)!</description></item><item><title>NewTek NDI</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/newtek-ndi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2018 19:19:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/newtek-ndi/</guid><description>NewTek NDI is a really amazing actually suite of software designed to transport audio and video data over networks.
Note: I recommend a gigabit connection between the producers and consumers, as it easily saturates 100 MB/s with all settings max&amp;rsquo;d.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it a while:

Except for the times when it&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip; (then, it&amp;rsquo;s not great! [Wow who knew!])
PP6 allows you to send stage messages remotely from the ProPresenter 6 iOS / Android app.
Unfortunately that application is a bit clunky, and there&amp;rsquo;s no Windows / desktop app&amp;hellip;
RICE Rally 2018 was coming up, and I needed some way to send Stage Display messages via my laptop.
If only there was a HTML/JavaScript solution&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;d really come in handy&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>School of Codecraft and Hackery</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2018winter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 18:52:17 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2018winter/</guid><description>Workshop Website
Day One - Introduction to Python Day Two - Microbits Microbit by BBC is a small piece of hardware with all sorts of sensors and outputs.
The uni purchased 20 of these!
Unfortunately, the accelerometer module isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and alot of the students couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one of the workshop instructions working.
The first activity was to build a firefly, using the wireless radios on the Microbit.</description></item></channel></rss>
