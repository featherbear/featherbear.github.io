      <description>At the start of 2018 I wrote a Python script called swec-elvanto-automation.
It was a set of task runners that would manage the automatic generation of the service bulletin, as well as pretty roster emails
&amp;hellip; well, I&amp;rsquo;m officially marking it as abandonware! It worked flawlessly, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t user friendly.
And also, with my other commitments taking more time, I don&amp;rsquo;t want my involvement and role at my church to become &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;irreplaceable&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;.</description>

      <description>What is UNSW CSE CompClub?
 I got the opportunity to take part in my uni computer society&amp;rsquo;s highschool program (again)!
Last time (Winter 2018) I volunteered as a mentor - those people who would help guide the students.
This time around I helped out as an organiser, in particular a content writer.
That means that I get a whole day to do whatever the heck I want! Yeeeeet!</description>

      <description>Uni holidays. Preoccupied myself with watching some Korean Drama.
My friend recommended me some series called City Hunter.
And&amp;hellip; it&amp;hellip; was&amp;hellip; alright actually!
I even watched some bits at 1x speed!
 Spoiler Time
Some Koreans go and do a secret mission in North Korea.
They complete their objective, but their gov chucks a sneaky and abandons them.
One survives, then steals the newborn of a fallen comrade&amp;rsquo;s wife and raises him up.</description>

      <description>The PreSonus StudioLive 16 and StudioLive 24R have an EtherCON port for their AVB connection.
You could forego the EtherCON connector and just connect an Ethernet cable, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had one occassion where a network stagebox got disconnected because the cable got kicked off.
Neutrik sells several EtherCON kits, the two I bought were Neutrik NE8MC and the Neutrik NE8MC-1.
(Didn&amp;rsquo;t need the CAT6 series, which would&amp;rsquo;ve been the NE8MX6 series)</description>

      <description>Got my hands on a Behringer X-Touch Mini USB MIDI Controller (Yay for Facebook Marketplace).
Will be using this in my Lightroom editing workflow!
Configuration Changing the MIDI Mapping The X-Touch Mini has 12 white buttons. With two layers, that would give us 24 different buttons. However some of the buttons were mapped to the same MIDI control key aka - some buttons are duplicate. So firstly, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to remap the surface.</description>

      <description>Python has two great web server libraries - Flask and Tornado.
Flask vs Tornado Why Flask Flask has a much easier to use routing functionality, where you just need a Python decorator @app.get(...).
In Tornado you need to set up a site router, and all these other things (or I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it right)
Why Tornado Tornado is a non-blocking server, which is able to handle multiple requests at the same time.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Well their Facebook page is down now, hurrah!
You know the saying: &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is&amp;rdquo;.
So my friend wanted to upgrade from their iPhone to a Galaxy S9+.
Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much about getting brand new goods (exceptions exist), so off to the races!
Hopped on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace to check for some sweet deals.
I found a few classifieds from a store called Masters iPhone - supposedly located in Western Australia.</description>

      <description>GitHub: featherbear/Whoops-There-Goes-My-AI
 So there&amp;rsquo;s a game on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store called Whoops! There Goes My Orange.
You play as an orange falling from the sky, and you have to avoid the red bars. Simple, right?
Yep! But rage-inducing.
Anyway, so I decided to have a crack at writing some sort of AI for this game&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;d just be a collision avoidance algorithm&amp;hellip; not really an AI.</description>

      <description>In a world full of noise, how do we find what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for?
 RICE Movement is a Christian organisation that brings the message of Jesus to high schoolers (of Australia, and now New Zealand too!)
RICE Rally is their annual event, a big evangelical &amp;lsquo;rally&amp;rsquo;.
I got the opportunity to serve with my brother in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).
Our playground was three LED walls and two confidence monitors.</description>

      <description>NewTek NDI is a really amazing actually suite of software designed to transport audio and video data over networks.
Note: I recommend a gigabit connection between the producers and consumersss, as it easily saturates 100 MB/s with all settings max&amp;rsquo;d.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it a while:

      <description>ProPresenter 6 is great!
Except for the times when it&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip; (then, it&amp;rsquo;s not great! [Wow who knew!])
PP6 allows you to send stage messages remotely from the ProPresenter 6 iOS / Android app.
Unfortunately that application is a bit clunky, and there&amp;rsquo;s no Windows / desktop app&amp;hellip;
 RICE Rally 2018 was coming up, and I needed some way to send Stage Display messages via my laptop.
If only there was a HTML/JavaScript solution&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;d really come in handy&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Workshop Website
Day One - Introduction to Python Day Two - Microbits Microbit by BBC is a small piece of hardware with all sorts of sensors and outputs.
The uni purchased 20 of these!
Unfortunately, the accelerometer module isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and alot of the students couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one of the workshop instructions working.
The first activity was to build a firefly, using the wireless radios on the Microbit.</description>
