      <title>Termius - My new SSH client</title>

      <description>See related post here: Mosh
 For the past n years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using PuTTY as my go-to Windows SSH client.
I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it to its fullest potential, but it did everything that I needed.
That is, it used to do everything that I needed&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m starting to use Mosh now, and so I needed to find a new SSH/Mosh client.
So with that said, say hello to Termius.</description>

      <description>Mosh is a remote terminal application that aims to overcome the issues that many other protocols face.
For me, Mosh addresses the lack of roaming support and intermittent network connectivity that I would face when trying to connect to servers whilst on the train or anywhere on the go.
(semi)technicalities Mosh connects to the server machine over SSH, meaning that there is no concern of a new avenue of vulnerability.</description>

      <title>PreSonus StudioLive API</title>

      <description>GitHub: github.com/featherbear/PreSonus-StudioLive-API
 I wanted to add functionality to the PreSonus StudioLive 16 Series III console. For example, to fade the level of a channel instead of instant (un)muting.
There is no MIDI interface for the console - so we would have to emulate the network messages sent from their UC Surface app.
Connection The console listens on TCP 53000
KeepAlive packets are sent periodically every 1 second.</description>

      <description>This semester I had a group assignment where we had to create an online ordering system for a ficticious company called GourmetBurgers.
Albeit it being a group assignment, and alot of waiting for my partners to finish their code; overall I found this assignment really fun to complete!
Especially to get a nice UI that would ultimately contribute towards 0% of my grade!

      <description>At the start of 2018, I built a cheap wireless DMX receiver as a parting &amp;lsquo;gift&amp;rsquo; to my high school (Heck, I even wrote a training manual).
Their system had i s s u e s.
Two broken lighting consoles, and the DMX cable that connects from the control room was damaged due to water damage.
So something had to be done!
 img { max-height: 50vh; }  I threw together an ESP8266 NodeMCU V3, a MAX485 chip, and added a barrel type DC socket</description>

      <description>Near the end of 2017, I wrote attempted to write a delivery tracker webpage that would list all of my tracked packages and their status information.
To sync my list of packages between my devices, I used a library called PeerJS that established P2P connections between my devices to send and receive data. PeerJS was dormant since 2015, and amazingly it worked for the duration of my code.
After a 3 year period of inactivity, PeerJS is back and alive (in active commits) so yay!</description>

      <description>Overnight Java decided to auto update itself even though I disabled automatic updates!?!
Consequently there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a firewall rule for the new Java installation path so my UniFi SDN went MIA.
That said, for my own future reference&amp;hellip;

Device username: To log into devices (ssh, usg http) - unique per site
Lesson learned - Don&amp;rsquo;t trust auto updaters D:</description>

      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m bored I often find myself scrolling Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace for deals - audio gear, camera gear, furniture, and when in &amp;lsquo;need&amp;rsquo; - network gear!
So I found a classified on Gumtree&amp;hellip;
8x Ubiquiti UniFi UAP - $10 each!!!
Unfortunately they were the UAP&amp;rsquo;s not the UAP-AC&amp;rsquo;s.
The UAP isn&amp;rsquo;t 10/100/1000, which is a shame, but nor were my old APs (but.. awhh)
And hey, $50 savings per unit.</description>

      <description>The PreSonus StudioLive 16 and StudioLive 24R have an EtherCON port for their AVB connection.
You could forego the EtherCON connector and just connect an Ethernet cable, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had one occassion where a network stagebox got disconnected because the cable got kicked off.
Neutrik sells several EtherCON kits, the two I bought were Neutrik NE8MC and the Neutrik NE8MC-1.
(Didn&amp;rsquo;t need the CAT6 series, which would&amp;rsquo;ve been the NE8MX6 series)</description>

      <description> $&amp;gt; ssh [SERVER] -L srcAddr:srcPort:dstAddr:dstPort
listens on srcAddr:srcPort which results in [SERVER] connecting to dstAddr:dstPort
&amp;gt; Useful for connecting to a device in a network
$&amp;gt; ssh [SERVER] -L srcPort:dstAddr:dstPort
[SERVER] listens on srcPort which is connecting to connecting to dstAddr:dstPort

      <description>ProPresenter 6 is great!
Except for the times when it&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip; (then, it&amp;rsquo;s not great! [Wow who knew!])
PP6 allows you to send stage messages remotely from the ProPresenter 6 iOS / Android app.
Unfortunately that application is a bit clunky, and there&amp;rsquo;s no Windows / desktop app&amp;hellip;
 RICE Rally 2018 was coming up, and I needed some way to send Stage Display messages via my laptop.
If only there was a HTML/JavaScript solution&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;d really come in handy&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>At UNSW, the Scientia building uses Raspberry Pis to manage the digital screens that display media and information.
In particular, they use PiSignage.
The general operational process for each device was:
1) Open the web interface 2) Authenticate 3) Upload a new media file 4) Add the media file to a playlist 5) Stop the playlist 6) Start the playlist
It seemed abit long-winded&amp;hellip; something that could be automated&amp;hellip;</description>
