Albeit it being a group assignment, and alot of waiting for my partners to finish their code; overall I found this assignment really fun to complete!
Especially to get a nice UI that would ultimately contribute towards 0% of my grade!

What is UNSW CSE CompClub?
On writing a CTF server
I got the opportunity to take part in my uni computer society&amp;rsquo;s highschool program (again)!
Last time (Winter 2018) I volunteered as a mentor - those people who would help guide the students.
This time around I helped out as an organiser, in particular a content writer.
That means that I get a whole day to do whatever the heck I want!</description></item><item><title>CompClub 2019 Summer CTF</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2019summer-ctf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 18:32:46 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2019summer-ctf/</guid><description>Read the whole CompClub 2019 Summer Workshop post

During the Winter 2018 Workshop, the organiser for the security day coded up a CTF website.
Technologies
Server: Flask (Python)
CSS: Bootstrap
Performance: RIP
Yeah so, Flask is a great Python web framework, with all of its routing magic.
But running a server with Flask alone is not a good idea&amp;hellip;
Flask should be run in a WSGI environment, but the inbuilt Flask server is not such.</description></item><item><title>UNSW COMP2521</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-comp2521/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 18:21:10 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-comp2521/</guid><description>Click here to go to the COMP2521 blog site</description></item><item><title>UNSW COMP1521</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-comp1521/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 18:21:05 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-comp1521/</guid><description>Click here to go to the COMP1521 blog site</description></item><item><title>School of Codecraft and Hackery</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2018winter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 18:52:17 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2018winter/</guid><description>Workshop Website
Day One - Introduction to Python Day Two - Microbits Microbit by BBC is a small piece of hardware with all sorts of sensors and outputs.
The uni purchased 20 of these!
Unfortunately, the accelerometer module isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and alot of the students couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one of the workshop instructions working.
The first activity was to build a firefly, using the wireless radios on the Microbit.</description></item></channel></rss>
