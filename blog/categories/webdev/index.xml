Whilst there was alot of desirable aspects, it sort of didn&amp;rsquo;t entirely work with my posts&amp;hellip; And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to customise Hugo&amp;hellip;
So the solution? Make your own theme!
I initially copied all the files from Aether into this theme, then just played around with each file
In the usual fashion, I used Bulma for my CSS framework.</description></item><item><title>Web Components</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/web-components/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 23:32:25 +1000</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/web-components/</guid><description>Scroll Nav / Scroll Spy

Albeit it being a group assignment, and alot of waiting for my partners to finish their code; overall I found this assignment really fun to complete!
Especially to get a nice UI that would ultimately contribute towards 0% of my grade!

To sync my list of packages between my devices, I used a library called PeerJS that established P2P connections between my devices to send and receive data. PeerJS was dormant since 2015, and amazingly it worked for the duration of my code.
After a 3 year period of inactivity, PeerJS is back and alive (in active commits) so yay!</description></item><item><title>Jebabej</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/jebabej/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 19:13:02 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/jebabej/</guid><description>Date: 28th February 2019

It supports many languages, and makes demoing and prototyping code a piece of cake.
It has some caveats though.
PyGame There&amp;rsquo;s no PyGame environment available on repl.it, making any PyGame project impossible.
Turtle The Turtle environment on repl.it is Python 2.7 - can&amp;rsquo;t teach Python 3.6 syntax here!

It worked flawlessly, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t user friendly.

What is UNSW CSE CompClub?
On writing a CTF server
I got the opportunity to take part in my uni computer society&amp;rsquo;s highschool program (again)!
Last time (Winter 2018) I volunteered as a mentor - those people who would help guide the students.
This time around I helped out as an organiser, in particular a content writer.
That means that I get a whole day to do whatever the heck I want!</description></item><item><title>CompClub 2019 Summer CTF</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2019summer-ctf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 18:32:46 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/unsw-compclub2019summer-ctf/</guid><description>Read the whole CompClub 2019 Summer Workshop post

Technologies
Server: Flask (Python)
CSS: Bootstrap
Performance: RIP
Yeah so, Flask is a great Python web framework, with all of its routing magic.
But running a server with Flask alone is not a good idea&amp;hellip;
Flask should be run in a WSGI environment, but the inbuilt Flask server is not such.</description></item><item><title>JavaScript Map</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/javascript-map/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 17:20:18 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/javascript-map/</guid><description>Don&amp;rsquo;t be lazy kids.

Flask vs Tornado Why Flask Flask has a much easier to use routing functionality, where you just need a Python decorator @app.get(...).
In Tornado you need to set up a site router, and all these other things (or I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it right)
Why Tornado Tornado is a non-blocking server, which is able to handle multiple requests at the same time.</description></item><item><title>HTML Script Tags</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/html-script-tags/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2018 00:44:52 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/html-script-tags/</guid><description>Source - growingwiththeweb.com

Except for the times when it&amp;rsquo;s not&amp;hellip; (then, it&amp;rsquo;s not great! [Wow who knew!])
PP6 allows you to send stage messages remotely from the ProPresenter 6 iOS / Android app.
Unfortunately that application is a bit clunky, and there&amp;rsquo;s no Windows / desktop app&amp;hellip;

Day One - Introduction to Python Day Two - Microbits Microbit by BBC is a small piece of hardware with all sorts of sensors and outputs.
The uni purchased 20 of these!
Unfortunately, the accelerometer module isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, and alot of the students couldn&amp;rsquo;t get one of the workshop instructions working.
The first activity was to build a firefly, using the wireless radios on the Microbit.</description></item></channel></rss>
