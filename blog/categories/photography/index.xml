      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s to spending too much money in November ðŸ¥‚
So yeah, it happened.
I finally got around to purchasing a 35mm prime lens for my camera!
 A year ago, I had purchased the YongNuo 35mm f/2 lens for about $160.
It took a month for it to arrive, which to my dismay was the wrong lens mount!
&amp;nbsp;
I had received the Nikon mount even though I had ordered the Canon mount!</description>

      <description>Last year my friend borrowed one of my tripods :)
It got water damage.
It corroded.
Damn you Brandon.
This time my friend went out to Norway to take some beautiful photos.
Guess who borrowed another of my tripods.
Guess who broke another tripod.
That&amp;rsquo;s right!
PSA: Don&amp;rsquo;t put tripods as luggage - Bring it on the plane! So, the tripod head somehow had dislodged from the body sometime and somewhere during his airplane flight back to Australia.</description>

      <description>Got my hands on a Behringer X-Touch Mini USB MIDI Controller (Yay for Facebook Marketplace).
Will be using this in my Lightroom editing workflow!
Configuration Changing the MIDI Mapping The X-Touch Mini has 12 white buttons. With two layers, that would give us 24 different buttons. However some of the buttons were mapped to the same MIDI control key aka - some buttons are duplicate. So firstly, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to remap the surface.</description>
