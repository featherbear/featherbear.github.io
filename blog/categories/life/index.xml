      <description>November was the month of spending for me. From preparing Christmas gifts, to being too eager and impatient to wait for Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales (But do they even happen down here in Australia???).

      <description>So I, used to be pretty into Minecraft.
That was, back in 2008.
&amp;nbsp;
In primary school, I used to play with my friends on a vanilla server, Icecraft.
In high school, I started getting into modding and server administration. We played with the Feed The Beast modpack, and eventually we played our own modpack, BearCrack.
&amp;nbsp;
I got into server administration - running servers, and contributing to Bukkit plugins.</description>

      <title>Brilliant Smart - WiFi LED Lights</title>
      <link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/brilliant-smart-wifi-led-lights/</link>

      <guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/brilliant-smart-wifi-led-lights/</guid>
      <description>I went to ALDI today and impulsively bought two boxes of these Brilliant Smart WiFi LED lights
$50 for three bulbs&amp;hellip; $100 for six bulbs&amp;hellip;
Seemed like a pretty good purchase to me - I could use them with my Home Assistant setup in my house!
These Brilliant Smart lights are just rebranded Tuya lights.
The first thing to do was to flash the bulb&amp;rsquo;s firmware with either Tasmota or ESPHome - custom firmwares for smart devices that would allow me to interact with them.</description>

      <description>My brother and I have been eyeing on a sale for the Mi Band 4, and we finally swooped to buy them at $40 AUD each!
I used to have a Mi Band 2, and one thing I liked about it was being able to see my Facebook Messenger notifications on them.
The Mi Band 4 is definitely an upgrade.
For starters, it has a larger screen with a much higher resolution.</description>

      <description>I ordered a Sonoff Mini, and it arrived in the mail today.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to connect it to my ceiling lights.
First thing&amp;rsquo;s first, Tasmota time!
We&amp;rsquo;ll be flashing Sonoff-Tasmota via Sonoff DIY OTA mode.

0) Download the stuff you need
- Sonoff DIY Tool

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been dual-booting my Dell Latitude 7390 with Windows 10 and Parrot since the start of 2018.
Recently, my Windows 10 installation had been bombarding me with a barrage of pretty blue screens with the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR message whenever I connected a USB device.
I tried updating my BIOS and other firmwares, nope.
I tried uninstalling softwares and drivers, nope.
I tried removing my Parrot OS microSD card, nope.
I tried to not plug in any USB device ever again&amp;hellip; it then started to crash even without a USB inserted.</description>

Technologies:
 Playback - ProPresenter 6 Playback - CasparCG Video Transport - NewTek NDI Video Mixing - Open Broadcaster Software  See Production on a Budget
Technical:
Timecode ProPresenter 6 does not have any timecode slave triggering, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any software (PVP, and a Mac) on us that would allow for that.
We had to manually sync the track by counting over our intercoms&amp;hellip;</description>

This is done by streaming the display, whilst also emulating keyboard, mouse, and even game controller input.
Getting started Getting Parsec set up was straightforward.

      <description>My friend introduced me to the Tabby Cat cult club.
It&amp;rsquo;s a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox which shows you a cute animal as your new tab page.
Essentially, as you open more tabs , you unlock new toys (and characters *).
Snooping around the source code (Firefox) we can see this
function shouldPickNewGoody(visits) { if (visits === 1) { return true; } else if (visits % 200 === 0) { return true; } else { return Math.</description>

      <description>Fear is subjective, tension is objective. - Some YouTube video.
I was watching a video [3:30] about how games (in this case Metroid Fusion) evoke emotion from the player - despite it just being a game.
Aided by sound effects, music, lighting, dialogue and story telling; our minds are synchronised with in-game character; and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing to consider that it was all purpose-driven by the game creators.

      <description>Last year my friend borrowed one of my tripods :)
It got water damage.
It corroded.
Damn you Brandon.
This time my friend went out to Norway to take some beautiful photos.
Guess who borrowed another of my tripods.
Guess who broke another tripod.
That&amp;rsquo;s right!
PSA: Don&amp;rsquo;t put tripods as luggage - Bring it on the plane! So, the tripod head somehow had dislodged from the body sometime and somewhere during his airplane flight back to Australia.</description>

      <description>I bought a thin-client for $20 today&amp;hellip;
Specs Processor: VIA C7 @ 1 GHz
Memory: 512 MB SODIMM
Flash: 44-pin 128 MB
Networking: 10/100/1000 Ethernet
USB: 6x USB 2.0
PS/2: Keyboard, Mouse
What am I going to do with it? I was thinking to use it as an NDI stream receiver.
That would mean installing a copy of Windows Vista/7 Embedded.
But first I would need more than 512 MB of RAM, and definitely more than 128 MB of storage&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Why I left
I stopped using Firefox in the late of November 2016, when Mozilla decided to pull the plug on, and severely restricted Firefox&amp;rsquo;s add-on platform, in favour of their WebExtensions API.
This issue with this was that the WebExtensions API was relatively high-level - meaning that my favourite extensions (ie DownThemAll!) would cease to work, as they relied on low level access.
Not being able to use DownThemAll! was a game changer for me - it was hands down the secret weapon under the sleeves of my Firefox vs Chrome war.</description>

      <description>When I&amp;rsquo;m bored I often find myself scrolling Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace for deals - audio gear, camera gear, furniture, and when in &amp;lsquo;need&amp;rsquo; - network gear!
So I found a classified on Gumtree&amp;hellip;
8x Ubiquiti UniFi UAP - $10 each!!!
Unfortunately they were the UAP&amp;rsquo;s not the UAP-AC&amp;rsquo;s.
The UAP isn&amp;rsquo;t 10/100/1000, which is a shame, but nor were my old APs (but.. awhh)
And hey, $50 savings per unit.</description>

      <description>Uni holidays. Preoccupied myself with watching some Korean Drama.
My friend recommended me some series called City Hunter.
And&amp;hellip; it&amp;hellip; was&amp;hellip; alright actually!
I even watched some bits at 1x speed!
 Spoiler Time
Some Koreans go and do a secret mission in North Korea.
They complete their objective, but their gov chucks a sneaky and abandons them.
One survives, then steals the newborn of a fallen comrade&amp;rsquo;s wife and raises him up.</description>

      <description>EDIT: Well their Facebook page is down now, hurrah!
You know the saying: &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is&amp;rdquo;.
So my friend wanted to upgrade from their iPhone to a Galaxy S9+.
Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much about getting brand new goods (exceptions exist), so off to the races!
Hopped on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace to check for some sweet deals.
I found a few classifieds from a store called Masters iPhone - supposedly located in Western Australia.</description>

      <description>In a world full of noise, how do we find what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for?
 RICE Movement is a Christian organisation that brings the message of Jesus to high schoolers (of Australia, and now New Zealand too!)
RICE Rally is their annual event, a big evangelical &amp;lsquo;rally&amp;rsquo;.
I got the opportunity to serve with my brother in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).
Our playground was three LED walls (and two confidence monitors)!</description>

      <title>Windows Updates - Sketchpad KB4505903</title>

      <guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/windows-sketchpad/</guid>
      <description>Having finally fixed my laptop, I booted into Windows to try to get some work done.
However, since KB4505903, Windows had removed Sketchpad! You know, the only useful ink workspace app.
Unfortunately, KB4505903 was not actually installed (rather some later version), and I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time nor patience to figure out which later update to remove.
Bummer.
I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll try out the &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; app, Whiteboard.
UPDATE
Having tried Whiteboard&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not bad.</description>
