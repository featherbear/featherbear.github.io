I stopped using Firefox in the late of November 2016, when Mozilla decided to pull the plug on, and severely restricted Firefox&amp;rsquo;s add-on platform, in favour of their WebExtensions API.
This issue with this was that the WebExtensions API was relatively high-level - meaning that my favourite extensions (ie DownThemAll!) would cease to work, as they relied on low level access.
Not being able to use DownThemAll! was a game changer for me - it was hands down the secret weapon under the sleeves of my Firefox vs Chrome war.</description></item><item><title>Home Network Upgrade</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/home-network-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 21:01:21 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/home-network-upgrade/</guid><description>When I&amp;rsquo;m bored I often find myself scrolling Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace for deals - audio gear, camera gear, furniture, and when in &amp;lsquo;need&amp;rsquo; - network gear!
So I found a classified on Gumtree&amp;hellip;
8x Ubiquiti UniFi UAP - $10 each!!!
Unfortunately they were the UAP&amp;rsquo;s not the UAP-AC&amp;rsquo;s.
The UAP isn&amp;rsquo;t 10/100/1000, which is a shame, but nor were my old APs (but.. awhh)
And hey, $50 savings per unit.</description></item><item><title>Tools of the Trade</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/tools-of-the-trade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2019 15:01:09 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/tools-of-the-trade/</guid><description>My Phone (Samsung S9+) Click to open

Preoccupied myself with watching some Korean Drama.
My friend recommended me some series called City Hunter.
And&amp;hellip; it&amp;hellip; was&amp;hellip; alright actually!
I even watched some bits at 1x speed!
Spoiler Time
Some Koreans go and do a secret mission in North Korea.
They complete their objective, but their gov chucks a sneaky and abandons them.
One survives, then steals the newborn of a fallen comrade&amp;rsquo;s wife and raises him up.</description></item><item><title>[SCAM] Masters iPhone</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/masters-iphone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 18:41:13 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/masters-iphone/</guid><description>EDIT: Well their Facebook page is down now, hurrah!
You know the saying: &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is&amp;rdquo;.
So my friend wanted to upgrade from their iPhone to a Galaxy S9+.
Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much about getting brand new goods (exceptions exist), so off to the races!
Hopped on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace to check for some sweet deals.
I found a few classifieds from a store called Masters iPhone - supposedly located in Western Australia.</description></item><item><title>RICE Rally 2018 Sydney</title><link>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/rice-rally-2018-sydney/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 19:19:44 +1100</pubDate><guid>http://featherbear.github.io/blog/post/rice-rally-2018-sydney/</guid><description>In a world full of noise, how do we find what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for?
RICE Movement is a Christian organisation that brings the message of Jesus to high schoolers (of Australia, and now New Zealand too!)
RICE Rally is their annual event, a big evangelical &amp;lsquo;rally&amp;rsquo;.
I got the opportunity to serve with my brother in the Production team (that is, lyrics and projection).
Our playground was three LED walls and two confidence monitors.</description></item></channel></rss>
