I got the opportunity to take part in my uni computer society's highschool program (again)!  
Last time ([Winter 2018](../unsw-compclub2018winter/)) I volunteered as a mentor - those people who would help guide the students.  

This time around I helped out as an organiser, in particular a content writer.  
That means that I get a whole day to do whatever the heck I want! Yeeeeet!  
The theme is "Secret Agent", and I got assigned to do the security stuff :D  

# Writing the Workshop
I planned my day to have a Security Talk, a Steganography tutorial, and a CTF game!

## SecTalk | HTTP vs HTTPS
A presentation on network security - of how plain text information (HTTPS) can intercepted by anyone on the network.

# Showtime
[summer2019.compclub.com.au](//summer2019.compclub.com.au)
## Day One - Introduction to Python
Day One was split into two streams, a beginner and an advanced stream.  
The beginner stream covered the fundamentals of Python - printing, input, string and number manipulation, if statements, loops.  
I helped out in the advanded stream, where they covered functions, global scope, and had a look into the `tkinter` library.

## Day Two - Game Development
Day Two was game development - where they used `turtle` to make a snake (what.)

## Day Three - Microbits (Hardware)
Students had a touch on programmable hardware, with the BBC Microbits

## Day Four - Website Development
Students used the Flask library along with the Google Maps and ipstack API to write an IP tracker.

## Day Five - Security
I didn't get the chance to go over the HTTP vs HTTPS slides for the sake of time, but the LSB Steganography tutorial went well.
