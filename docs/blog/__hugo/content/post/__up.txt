Up Money

A friend introduced me to a new digital bank called Up Money

It's backed by Bendigo Bank and the Bank Of Adelaide

2.75%pa rate for 4 months (prior to...) 
After 4 months, back to 0.75%, or if you make 5 purchases within that month

Is it safe? 
What if I lose my phone / change phone number? 
Unexpected close down - what happens to my money 
Online interface?

Compared to Xinja

Xinja is not a bank 
Up is a bank 

Xinja better for travelling 
Up strictly for interest.. But little money.. No point 

Commbank for real life facilities (Australia no longer has cross bank atm fees) 
Up to store money - get rid of this app later ; unless the 2.75 rate stays 
Xinja for day to day
